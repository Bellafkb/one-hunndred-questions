GAMEMODES
Random: select 100 random questions
Classic: only display the first 100 questions from the list (in that exact order)
Sexual: like random but only for sexual questions
Friendly: like random but only for non-sexual questions

After reaching 100 questions:
* User can choose to keep playing and can select a number of new questions to play (10,20,30,...,100)
* New questions are selected randomly out of the pool (for sexual or friendly select randomly from the new smaller pool of questions)
* after finishing the newly added questions a user can still increase the amount of questions until there are none left

User questions:
* add the user questions to the general question pool before picking 100 questions
* remember to differentiate between the language of the added user question
